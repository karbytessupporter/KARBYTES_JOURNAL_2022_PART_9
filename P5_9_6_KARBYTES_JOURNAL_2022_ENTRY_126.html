<p>One thing which has been troubling me is not having headphones. (As soon as I get approximately $20, I will get some over-ear headphones from Target). I need some kind of noise which I can use as an anchor for my concentration and as a means to mask distracting and daresay even thought-stopingly intrusive noises from the environment so that I can enjoy some semblance of inner peace (while hooked up to&nbsp; a computer, of course). As someone who spends almost all of its time outdoors and as someone who (seemingly to itself) desires more than anything to engage in introspection and other solitary interests, having decent headphones is not a luxury but, rather a necessity. Otherwise, I am literally in hell (but so far I have been able to endure such hell without regressing into destructive behavior). (One trick I do to make cheap noise canceling headphones is put ear plugs into my ear canals before putting the over ear headphones on and then playing some kind of looping noise generator or loud music).</p>
<p>(Note: a library of free online noise generators exists at the website whose Uniform Resource Locator is <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://mynoise.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://mynoise.net/</a>).</p>
<p>One of the aspects of my life which I find most disturbing is the fact that, every minute of every day since early 2019, I have been barraged with bullying and controlling auditory harassment from law enforcement seemingly in response to my real-time thoughts (and such that I appear to have no privacy even inside of my mind). I think that the noises I hear are the result of <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_auditory_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microwave auditory effect</a> and the fact that my thoughts appear to be accessible to people outside of my head is the result of some kind of artificial intelligence using a comprehensive model of my brain to predict exactly what the content of my thoughts will be at specific times (and also because my body is almost always exposed to the sky where stealthy surveillance drones can pick up data about my body such as heat and movement).</p>
